from were be bought domain name is called ---registar service (Route 53)
---------------------------------Record Set---------------------------
1.IPV4 A    Record

2.APV6 AAAA Record

3.CName Record(Canonical)---- ( Name on name)
--other record sets

4.MX Record -A mail exchange (MX) record in the Domain Name System (DNS) directs email messages to a mail server on behalf of a domain name. MX records are important for: Differentiating web and email servers, Creating redundancy, Load balancing email traffic, and Troubleshooting mail delivery problems

5.NAPTR (A Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) record is a type of resource record in the Domain Name System (DNS) that maps the internet telephony address space to the internet address space. NAPTR records are often used in internet telephony applications, such as mapping servers and user addresses in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). They can also be used to map E.164 numbers, which are telephone numbers, to URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) or IP addresses. This allows users to reach devices like fax machines and VoIP phones on the internet using telephone numbers. 

6.NS (An NS record, or nameserver record, is a DNS record that contains the name of the authoritative name server for a domain or DNS zone. NS records are essential for people to use DNS names to reach services, and without them, DNS queries are not possible)

7.SOA (A DNS (domain name system) start of authority (SOA) record is a record that contains administrative information about a zone or domain. It's required for all DNS zones to comply with IETF standards)

8.TXT (A TXT record, or text record, is a type of Domain Name System (DNS) record that stores text-based information about a domain. TXT records can contain both human-readable and machine-readable data. They can be used for a variety of purposes, including: Domain ownership verification, Email spam prevention, Framework policies, General information, and Points of contact for the domain)

9.CAA (A Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) record is a type of Domain Name Server (DNS) record that allows domain owners to specify which certificate authorities (CAs) are allowed to issue SSL certificates for their domain. Before issuing a certificate, the CA checks the CAA records and blocks the request if the CA is not listed. If there is no CAA record, any CA can issue a certificate for the domain)

10.PTR (A DNS pointer record (PTR) is a record in the Domain Name System (DNS) that maps an IP address to a domain name. PTR records are also known as reverse DNS records and are the opposite of A records, which map domain names to IP addresses)


when we are configure ip with name it is called ---record set 
															   
															   
when you put name behind name ex www.fb.com -----> example.com ----(Cname Record Canonical)	


AWS has 4 load balancer

1.Application LB     -- Web application traffic
2.Network LB         -- process to process traffic  (Faster) (ultra low latency)
3.Classic LB
4.Gateway G/w LB														   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Target Groups
  
               -  Server one ( we can put more than one server in target group)
              -
Laod Balancer --  Server two
             -
			  -   Server Three

Routing Policies
1.simple   (It wont check server healthy status)
2.weight
3.latency
4.geolocation (A geolocation routing policy routes traffic to a web server based on the geographic location of the user's DNS query)
5.multivalue (it is same as simple routing policy but its check servers health)
6.failover
7.subnet
8.Geoproximity (Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and, optionally, shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another.)

When you create a record, you choose a routing policy, which determines how Amazon Route 53 responds to queries:

SIMPLE ROUTING POLICY – Use for a single resource that performs a given function for your domain, for example, a web server that serves content for the example.com website. You can use simple routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

FAILOVER ROUTING POLICY – Use when you want to configure active-passive failover. You can use failover routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

GEOLOCATION ROUTING POLICY – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users. You can use geolocation routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

GEOPROXIMITY ROUTING POLICY – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and, optionally, shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another location. You can use geoproximity routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

LATENCY ROUTING POLICY – Use when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to the Region that provides the best latency. You can use latency routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

IP-BASED ROUTING POLICY – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users, and have the IP addresses that the traffic originates from.

MULTIVALUE ANSWER ROUTING POLICY – Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random. You can use multivalue answer routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

WEIGHTED ROUTING POLICY – Use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify. You can use weighted routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

What is difference betweem GEOLOCATION & GEOPROXIMITY ?
